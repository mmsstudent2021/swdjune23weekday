Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes describing what you want to achieve without specifying how to achieve it. In other words, you declare the desired outcome, and the programming language or framework takes care of the implementation details. JavaScript supports declarative programming through various features and libraries. Here's an example of declarative programming in JavaScript:


In this React example, we declare the desired UI structure based on the `name` state. When the user types in the input field, the `handleInputChange` function is called, and React takes care of updating the UI to reflect the new state. This is a declarative approach because we specify what the UI should look like based on the data (state), and React handles the rendering.

**Example 1: Declarative Data Transformation with Array Methods**

JavaScript provides array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, which allow you to perform declarative data transformations.

```javascript
const numbers = [4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 7, 1, 4];

// try these
// 0. sum of all element
// 1. remove duplicate element
// 2. the sum each element value to double
// 3. remove odd element

```

In this example, we use array methods to declaratively manipulate the data. We define what we want to achieve (e.g., doubling numbers, filtering even numbers, or summing the array) without specifying how to do it in detail.

Declarative programming can lead to more readable and maintainable code because it abstracts away low-level implementation details and allows you to focus on expressing your intent. It's commonly used in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries to build user interfaces and work with data transformations.
