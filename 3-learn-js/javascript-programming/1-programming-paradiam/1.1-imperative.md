Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing a sequence of steps that a program must take to achieve a specific goal. It's centered around changing program state through statements and commands. Here's an example of imperative programming in JavaScript:

```javascript
// An array of numbers
const numbers = [4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 7, 1, 4];

// Initialize a variable to store the sum
let sum = 0;

// Iterate through the array using a for loop
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  // Add each number to the sum
  sum += numbers[i];
}

// Print the final sum
console.log("The sum of the numbers is:", sum);


// try these
// 1. remove duplicate element
// 2. the sum each element value to double
// 3. remove odd element

```

In this example, we use a `for` loop to iterate through an array of numbers and calculate their sum. The code explicitly specifies the sequence of steps: initializing a sum variable, looping through the array, and updating the sum in each iteration. This is characteristic of imperative programming, where you describe "how" to perform a task in a step-by-step manner.

Imperative programming can be useful for tasks where you need fine-grained control over the sequence of operations, but it can sometimes result in code that's harder to read and maintain, especially for complex tasks. Other programming paradigms like declarative programming and functional programming aim to address some of these challenges by focusing on "what" should be done rather than "how" it should be done.
