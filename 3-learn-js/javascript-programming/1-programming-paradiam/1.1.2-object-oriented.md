Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. In OOP, objects represent real-world entities or concepts, and the code is structured to model and manipulate these objects. JavaScript supports OOP features, and you can use it to create and work with objects. Here are the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript:

1. **Objects**:
   - An object is a collection of properties (attributes) and methods (functions).
   - Properties represent the state or characteristics of an object.
   - Methods represent the behaviors or actions that an object can perform.

   ```javascript
   // Creating an object
   const person = {
     firstName: 'John',
     lastName: 'Doe',
     sayHello: function () {
       console.log(`Hello, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
     },
   };

   // Accessing object properties and calling methods
   console.log(person.firstName); // Output: John
   person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, John Doe
   ```

2. **Classes**:
   - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects created from it will have.
   - JavaScript introduced the `class` keyword in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to support class-based OOP.

   ```javascript
   // Defining a class
   class Person {
     constructor(firstName, lastName) {
       this.firstName = firstName;
       this.lastName = lastName;
     }

     sayHello() {
       console.log(`Hello, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
     }
   }

   // Creating objects from the class
   const person1 = new Person('John', 'Doe');
   const person2 = new Person('Alice', 'Smith');

   person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, John Doe
   person2.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, Alice Smith
   ```

3. **Inheritance**:
   - Inheritance allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass or base class).
   - JavaScript supports single inheritance through its prototype chain.

   ```javascript
   // Base class
   class Animal {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }

     speak() {
       console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound`);
     }
   }

   // Subclass inheriting from the base class
   class Dog extends Animal {
     constructor(name, breed) {
       super(name);
       this.breed = breed;
     }

     speak() {
       console.log(`${this.name} barks loudly`);
     }
   }

   const dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');
   dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy barks loudly
   ```

4. **Encapsulation**:
   - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (properties) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (object).
   - It helps hide the internal state of an object and exposes only the necessary functionality.

   ```javascript
   class BankAccount {
     constructor(accountNumber, balance) {
       this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
       this.balance = balance;
     }

     deposit(amount) {
       this.balance += amount;
     }

     withdraw(amount) {
       if (amount <= this.balance) {
         this.balance -= amount;
       } else {
         console.log('Insufficient funds');
       }
     }

     getBalance() {
       return this.balance;
     }
   }

   const account = new BankAccount('12345', 1000);
   account.deposit(500);
   account.withdraw(300);
   console.log(account.getBalance()); // Output: 1200
   ```

Object-Oriented Programming promotes code reusability, modularity, and a natural way of modeling real-world entities in software. JavaScript's support for classes and objects allows you to apply OOP principles to your code to create more organized and maintainable applications.
