The code you provided primarily follows the **imperative programming paradigm**. Here's why:

1. **DOM Manipulation**: The code interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) using methods like `getElementById`, `innerHTML`, and event listeners. Imperative programming is well-suited for tasks involving direct control and manipulation of elements in the DOM.

2. **Step-by-Step Execution**: The code defines functions and event handlers that are executed in response to user actions (e.g., clicking a button). It specifies the exact sequence of steps to perform when these actions occur.

3. **State Management**: The code maintains and updates the state of the application in the form of the `tasks` array. It explicitly adds and removes items from the array to reflect changes in the application's state.

4. **Explicit Control Flow**: The code controls the flow of execution through conditional statements (e.g., checking if an element is a button) and function calls. It clearly outlines the logic for adding and removing tasks.

While imperative programming is suitable for this kind of application, you can also incorporate aspects of declarative programming using frameworks like React or Vue.js. These frameworks allow you to define the UI in a more declarative manner, where you specify what the UI should look like based on the current state, and the framework takes care of updating the DOM accordingly. This can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code for complex applications.
