Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **HTML Structure (index.html):**

   This HTML file sets up the basic structure of the To-Do list web page. It includes a title, an input field for adding tasks, a button to add tasks, and an unordered list (ul) to display the tasks. A script tag at the end references the `index.js` file using the `type="module"` attribute, indicating that it's an ES6 module.

2. **CSS Styles (style.css):**

   The CSS file provides some basic styling to make the To-Do list look more appealing. It styles the container, input field, and button to make them visually consistent.

3. **JavaScript Modules (src/todo.js and src/index.js):**

   - **todo.js**: This module contains the core logic for managing tasks. It defines an empty array `tasks` to store the tasks and provides three functions:
   
     - `addTask(task)`: Pushes a new task into the `tasks` array.
     - `removeTask(index)`: Removes a task at a specified index from the `tasks` array.
     - `getTasks()`: Returns the current list of tasks.

   - **index.js**: This module handles the interaction between the HTML (DOM) and the `todo.js` module. It imports the functions from `todo.js` and uses them to add and remove tasks and to render the tasks on the web page.

     - It first selects the necessary elements from the DOM using `getElementById`.
     - `renderTasks()`: This function updates the unordered list (`taskList`) with the current list of tasks. It clears the list and then creates list items (li) for each task, including a "Remove" button.
     - `addTaskHandler()`: This function is called when the "Add" button is clicked. It gets the task from the input field, adds it to the `tasks` array using `addTask()`, clears the input field, and then calls `renderTasks()` to update the displayed tasks.
     - `removeTaskHandler(event)`: This function is called when a "Remove" button is clicked. It checks if the clicked element is a button and then retrieves the task's index from the button's `data-index` attribute. It removes the task from the `tasks` array using `removeTask()` and updates the displayed tasks with `renderTasks()`.
     - Event listeners are added to the "Add" button and the task list to handle user interactions.

4. **Initialization and Rendering:**

   - After defining event handlers and functions, the script immediately calls `renderTasks()` to render the initial state of the tasks (which is empty at the beginning).
   
5. **Testing:**

   - To test the code, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You'll see the To-Do list interface.
   - You can add tasks by typing into the input field and clicking "Add."
   - You can remove tasks by clicking the "Remove" button next to each task.

This code creates a basic To-Do list application that allows users to add and remove tasks dynamically using the DOM. You can further enhance this project by adding features like task completion, due dates, and persistent storage.
