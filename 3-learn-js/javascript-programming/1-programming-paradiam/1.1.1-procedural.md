Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that structures code around procedures or functions. It emphasizes reusability and modularity by breaking down a program into smaller, reusable functions that perform specific tasks. While modern programming often incorporates other paradigms like object-oriented or functional programming, procedural programming remains a fundamental concept.

Here's an example of procedural programming in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Procedural programming example in JavaScript

// Define a function to calculate the area of a rectangle
function calculateRectangleArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}

// Define a function to calculate the area of a circle
function calculateCircleArea(radius) {
  return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}

// Define a function to display the result
function displayResult(shape, area) {
  console.log(`The area of the ${shape} is ${area}`);
}

// Calculate the area of a rectangle
const rectangleWidth = 5;
const rectangleHeight = 10;
const rectangleArea = calculateRectangleArea(rectangleWidth, rectangleHeight);
displayResult("rectangle", rectangleArea);

// Calculate the area of a circle
const circleRadius = 3;
const circleArea = calculateCircleArea(circleRadius);
displayResult("circle", circleArea);
```

In this example:

1. We define reusable functions `calculateRectangleArea`, `calculateCircleArea`, and `displayResult`, each responsible for a specific task.

2. We call these functions with appropriate arguments to perform calculations and display results. The main program flow is controlled by function calls and parameter passing.

Procedural programming is often straightforward and intuitive for solving problems that can be divided into discrete steps or tasks. It can help promote code reusability and maintainability by breaking down complex logic into smaller, manageable functions.

However, as applications grow in size and complexity, procedural programming may become less suitable because it can lead to functions with many parameters and global variables. In such cases, other paradigms like object-oriented programming or functional programming may offer better organization and maintainability options.
