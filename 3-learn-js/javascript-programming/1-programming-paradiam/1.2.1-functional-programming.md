Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, and it supports functional programming features. Here are some key concepts and examples of functional programming in JavaScript:

**1. Pure Functions:**

Pure functions are the cornerstone of functional programming. They produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Impure function with side effect
let total = 0;
function add(x) {
  total += x;
  return total;
}

// Pure function
function pureAdd(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

In the `add` function, the `total` variable is modified, and it has a side effect. In contrast, `pureAdd` is a pure function because it only depends on its arguments and doesn't modify external state.

**2. Higher-Order Functions:**

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions. They enable powerful abstractions and are a key feature of functional programming.

```javascript
// Map: Apply a function to each element of an array
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((x) => x * 2);

// Filter: Select elements that meet a condition
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((x) => x % 2 === 0);

// Reduce: Combine elements into a single value
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0);
```

In the above examples, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are higher-order functions because they take functions as arguments.

**3. Immutability:**

Functional programming promotes immutability, where data structures are not modified after creation. Instead, new data structures are created with the desired changes.

```javascript
// Immutable array
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((x) => x * 2);

// Immutable object
const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };
const updatedPerson = { ...person, age: 31 }; // Creating a new object
```

**4. Recursion:**

Functional programming often relies on recursion instead of traditional loops for repetitive tasks.

```javascript
// Recursive factorial calculation
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

**5. Function Composition:**

Function composition is combining multiple functions to produce a new function.

```javascript
// Function composition
const compose = (f, g) => (x) => f(g(x));

const addOne = (x) => x + 1;
const double = (x) => x * 2;
const addOneThenDouble = compose(double, addOne);

console.log(addOneThenDouble(5)); // Result: 12
```

Functional programming helps you write code that is easier to reason about, test, and maintain. It's commonly used in modern JavaScript, especially with libraries like React and Redux. However, it's essential to strike a balance between functional and imperative programming paradigms, as each has its strengths and use cases.
